# Factor-World

Extends Metaworld environments with 10 visual factors of variation. 
Uses modern `mujoco` bindings and the `gymnasium` interface.

## Usage

Install the package
```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ factor-world==0.1.1
```

Then use the factor wrapper as follows:
```python
from factorworld.envs import make_env_with_factors
from factorworld.envs.tasks.sawyer_pick_place_v2 import SawyerPickPlaceEnvV2

env = make_env_with_factors(
    env_cls = SawyerPickPlaceEnvV2, 
    env_kwargs = {"render_mode": "human"}, 
    factor_kwargs = {'table_texture': {}}
)
env.reset()
obs = env.reset()
print("Current factor: ", env.current_factor_value)

for _ in range(100):
    env.step(env.action_space.sample())
    env.render()
```

For a list of all available factors:
```
from factorworld.envs import list_factors
print(list_factors())
```

## Factor-World

### Factors

Here is a visualization of some of the factors of variation

Left to right: `table_texture`, `camera_pos`, `object_pos`

For all visualizations please look at `docs/assets/*.gif`

### Tasks

Currently we have only implemented `SawyerPickPlaceEnvV2`. We are working on migrating more environments from Metaworld. Pull requests are welcome.
